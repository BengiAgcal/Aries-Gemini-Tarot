COMP4521 Final App Project.

# Introduction

Tarot is an ancient practice of using a special deck of cards to gain insight into the past, present, and future. The divinatory use of the cards and the well-designed symbolism behind the meanings address the various cases of human existence, helping one to see and redirect their intentions from a spiritual perspective.  

For this project, our primary goal is to address the shortcomings of the current tarot apps and include a human touch to help the users experience a full real tarot experience on a digital platform. 

We want to create a space on our platform where the users can meditate, reflect on their intentions, and get directed to the tarot reading that their energy guides them towards.
